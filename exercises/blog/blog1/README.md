Design a blog
22 APRIL 2016
Create a website that contains the following:

A fixed horizontal navbar (meaning it is always on the top of the page, even if you scroll down)

A blog-style feed, where each blog post (which you'll just hard-code in for now) is in the center of the page, and as your scroll down the page it shows older blog posts.

Each blog post should have a title of some kind

Each blog post should have the date it was "published"

Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text should wrap around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped text.

The blog posts' content can just be hard-coded, meaning it'll all just be on a single page and you can just put filler text (lorem ipsum) there if you want.
