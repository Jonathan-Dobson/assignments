            THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT
        </h3>
        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS
        support, and abandoned browsers.

        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk
        like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.

        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with
        clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.
        <h3>

            SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
        </h3>
        There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
        participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
        sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file.
        Yes, really.

        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
        illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
        placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed
        to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

            PARTICIPATION
        </h3>
        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary
        too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points.
        Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.

        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve
        never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.

        Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and
        please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link
        to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place
        it on our server.
        <h3>
            BENEFITS
        </h3>
        Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing CSS
        really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for
        those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.

            REQUIREMENTS
        </h3>
        Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
        elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and
        not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is
        that your CSS validates.
