                THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT
            </h3>
            Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <span
                class="dotted-underline">DOM</span>s, broken <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span>
            support, and abandoned browsers.
            <p>

                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts
                of
                folk
                like the <span class="dotted-underline">W3C</span>, <span class="dotted-underline">WASP</span>, and the
                major browser creators.

            <h3>
                SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
            </h3>
            There is a continuing need to show the power of <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span>. The Zen Garden
            aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
            participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
            style
            sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <span
                class="dotted-underline">CSS</span>
            file.
            Yes, really.
            <p>
                <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style of a
                hypertext document. The only way this can be

                illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins
                are
                placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
                contributed
                to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                PARTICIPATION
            </h3>
            <p>

                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <span
                    class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> skills are
                necessary
                too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span>
                novices can use them as starting
                points.
                Please see the <span class="blue-link"> <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> Resource Guide</span>
                for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span>.

                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if
                you’ve
                never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
                guide.

                Download the sample <span class="blue-link">HTML</span> and <span class="blue-link">CSS</span> to work
                on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece
                (and
                please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> file to a
                web server under your control. <span class="blue-link">Send us a link</span>
                to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and
                place
                it on our server.

                REQUIREMENTS
            </h3>

            Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span class="dotted-underline">CSS 1 & 2</span> usage. <span
                class="dotted-underline">CSS 3 & 4</span> should be limited to
            widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
            functional, practical <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks
            viewable by 2% of the browsing public.
            The only real requirement we have is that your <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> validates.
            <p>

            </p>
            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <span
                class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> by now. When sticking to
            the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number
            of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not
            be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work
            in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the
            population).
            <p>

                We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re
                well past the point of needing another garden-related design.

                This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
                limited exceptions, see <span class="blue-link">submission guidelines</span>), but we ask you release
                your <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> under a Creative Commons
                license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.
