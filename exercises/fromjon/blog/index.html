                    JavaScript is in my opinion the best programming language around for many reasons. One reason is
                    that it is cross-platform.It is used in almost every web browser installed on nearly every major
                    operating system for laptops, desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Another reason JavaScript is so
                    awesome is that the language and sytax has been simplified and reduced to its most basic essential
                    parts, making writing, and developing more intuitive than many other programming languages.

                    Here are the requirments for this blog exersise copied from the lesson page:
                    <br />
                    Create a website that contains the following:
                    <hr /><br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>A fixed horizontal navbar (meaning it is always on the top of the page, even if you scroll
                            down)</li>
                        <li>A blog-style feed, where each blog post (which you'll just hard-code in for now) is in the
                            center of the page, and as your scroll down the page it shows older blog posts.</li>
                        <li>Each blog post should have a title of some kind</li>
                        <li>Each blog post should have the date it was "published"</li>
                        <li>Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text
                            should wrap around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped
                            text.</li>

                    </ul>


                    The blog posts' content can just be hard-coded, meaning it'll all just be on a single page and you
                    can just put filler text (lorem ipsum) there if you want.
                </div>
            </div>

                    Welcome to my second Blog. This blog site was created to practice designing layouts using simple
                    CSS. After creating the basics of the Blog site, I realized it needed to work better on my
                    mobile device, so I decided to add a media query so my blog will be easy to read and use on both
                    mobile screens and larger desktop displays</div>

                    Here I begin my journey into the world of web design at V School. I have never considered myself a
                    natural-born designer, and I anticipate becoming one will take a much more time and practice.</div>
